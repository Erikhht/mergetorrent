mergetorrent combines multiple, partial downloads to make downloads more complete.  (Works only if you have uTorrent installed.)

# Using mergetorrent: #

  1. Add all the .torrent files that you want to fix.  Also add any files or directories that might have relevant files.  Don't worry if you add extra files or directories, mergetorrent will figure it out.
  1. **Exit uTorrent.**  If don't, uTorrent might get confused.
  1. Press "Start!".  The process might take a few minutes depending on how many torrents there are.  (Around 1 minute per Gigabyte of data.)
  1. Restart uTorrent.
  1. **Stop all the torrents that you merged and "Force re-check" on them.**
  1. Now you can start the torrents again.

# Examples: #

  * You start downloading the same torrent on two different computers and each gets to 50% individually but probably not the same 50%.  By combining the results of the two properly, you probably already have 75% and may have 100%!
  * You start downloading two different torrents that both include the same file.  Each gets to 50% on the common file.  By combining the common file, you probably have 75% already and may have 100%.

# Other solutions: #

  * Pick the most complete download.  This isn't a combine and the progress on the less complete download is lost.
  * Install two bittorrent clients on the same machine and convince the two clients to download from one another on the loaclhost.  This is complicated.
  * Put each torrent on a different computer on the same network and convince the two clients to download from one another.  This, too, is complicated.
