How to use mergetorrent

# Details #
  1. Add all the .torrent files that you want to fix.
  1. Add any files or directories that might have relevant files.  Don't worry if you add extra files or directories, mergetorrent will figure it out.  When you add a directory, all the subdirectories beneath it get added, too.
  1. **Exit uTorrent.**  uTorrent gets confused if you merge while uTorrent is running.
  1. Press "Start!". The process might take a few minutes depending on how many torrents there are. (Around 1 minute per gigabyte of data.)
  1. Restart uTorrent.
  1. **Stop all the torrents that you merged and "Force re-check" on them.**  If you don't do this, uTorrent won't notice the progress.  You can only force re-check on stopped torrents.
  1. Now you can start the torrents again.
